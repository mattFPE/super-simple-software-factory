"""ADW Simple SDLC — plan, build, test, review, document, committing as it goes.

Usage:
    uv run adws/adw_simple_sdlc.py "<prompt, path/to/prompt.md, or #42>" [--config adws/adw_sssf_config/sssf.config.yaml] [--adw-id a1b2c3d4]
        [--branch | --merge | --pr] [--in-place [--allow-dirty]] [--force]

Runs in its own worktree on branch sssf/<adw_id> (see adw_modules/worktree.py);
your checkout is never touched. --in-place works in your checkout instead.

An issue as the prompt (`"#42"` or its URL; see adw_modules/issues.py) must be
labelled ready-for-agent and unblocked. The run claims it, lands as a PR that
closes it, and comments on it with the outcome.

Phases: engineer(request) -> planner -> git(commit_plan)
        -> builder -> code(test) [-> builder(fix) -> code(test) ... bounded]
        -> reviewer [-> builder(revise) -> reviewer ... bounded]
        -> code(retest, only if a revision changed code)
        -> git(commit_build) -> code(changes) -> documenter -> git(commit_docs)

Three commits, three work products, three authors. The plan, the code, and the
write-up each land in their own commit, and each commit message is the words of
the agent that produced it — `commit_message` on PlanOutput describes the spec,
on BuildOutput the code, on DocumentOutput the write-up. No agent's sentence is
ever reused for another agent's diff.

Testing is CODE, not an agent. `bun test` is a command, not a judgement call:
an agent rediscovering it every run costs a million tokens to learn what a
subprocess already knows. Failures travel back to the builder as an envelope,
so the repair loop is unchanged — only the runner became free and repeatable.

Two different questions still get asked, in order. The suite asks "does it
run"; the reviewer asks "is this what was asked for", against `plan.md` — and
neither can answer the other's. A revision that closes a review finding
re-enters the suite, so the tree that gets committed is the tree that was both
tested and approved.

The code commit lands after verification, not straight after the build: fixes
and revisions are part of the same work product, and red code has no business
on the branch. A run that fails verification therefore leaves the plan
committed and the working tree dirty — the spec is a real artifact either way,
and the unfinished code stays where the engineer can see it.

The documenter measures against the commit this run STARTED from, not against
`main`, because by then the run has moved `main` itself. That baseline is
pinned before the first commit phase and printed in the request phase.
